/* ... (existing content, implied, I will paste the whole file + changes) */
/* Wait, I need to read the whole file first to paste it back. The `type` command truncated it. 
   I should use `read_resource` or `view_file` again? 
   `view_file` works on text/plain usually. The previous `view_file` on index.css worked in Step 2.
   Why did `replace_file_content` fail? "failed to detect charset".
   Maybe there are some weird characters.
   I will try `view_file` again to get the WHOLE content, then `write_to_file`.
